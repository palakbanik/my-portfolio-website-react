                                I'm a passionate, self-proclaimed designer who
                                specializes in front-end development. I am very
                                enthusiastic about bringing the technical and
                                visual aspects of digital products to life. User
                                experience, pixel perfect design, and writing
                                clear, readable, highly performant code matters
                                to me.

                            <p>
                                I began my journey as a web developer in 2024,
                                and since then, I've continued to grow and
                                evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges
                                and learning the latest technologies along the
                                way. I'm building cutting-edge web applications
                                using modern technologies such as Next.js,
                                TypeScript, Tailwindcss and much more.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy
                                working on products end to end, from ideation
                                all the way to development.
                            </p>
